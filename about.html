            <p>
                Welcome to Applied AI Observer, a newsletter exploring how AI writing tools like ChatGPT are transforming education, research, and the writing process.
            </p>

            <p>
                This newsletter is part of CAH 205: Fundamentals of Applied AI at Lindenwood University. Each week, I cover developments in AI writing tools and how these technologies are being used in educational contexts.

            <h3>About the Author</h3>
            <p>
                I'm Nicholas Best, a student at Lindenwood University. I use AI to help with schoolwork, get information about my hobbies, and improve my writing. Since I am autistic, AI tools have been especially helpful for understanding certain concepts and expressing my ideas more clearly.
            </p>
