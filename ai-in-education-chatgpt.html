            <h2>AI Tools Like ChatGPT Are Reshaping Education</h2>
            <p class="date">January 22, 2026</p>

            <p>
                AI writing tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being integrated into classroom assignments, signaling a shift in how educators approach artificial intelligence.
            </p>

            <p>
                Instead of banning AI tools, many instructors now require students to use them for brainstorming, outlining, summarizing sources, or revising drafts. The focus has moved toward transparency, ethical use, and critical thinking rather than avoidance.
            </p>

            <p>
                OpenAI’s classroom-friendly features, including explanation-based responses and iterative feedback, support learning while still holding students accountable for original thought. This approach helps students develop AI literacy alongside traditional writing skills.
            </p>

            <p>
                This change matters because AI tools are becoming standard in professional environments. Teaching students how to use them responsibly prepares them for real-world workflows. I chose this topic because it directly connects to how education is adapting to rapid technological change.
