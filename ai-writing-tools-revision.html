        <h2>AI as a Pedagogical Partner</h2>
        <p>In 2026, the focus of AI in education has shifted from "answering" to "coaching." The partnership between Google and Khan Academy has birthed a tool that uses <strong>Gemini</strong> to guide students through the revision process.</p>
        <p>Instead of rewriting a paragraph for a student, the AI asks: <em>"Your thesis is strong, but how could you provide more evidence in the second sentence?"</em> This keeps the student in the driver's seat.</p>

        <h2>Efficiency vs. Meaning</h2>
        <p>This post discusses the "Human-Centered" approach to AI writing. While AI can draft 1,000 words in seconds, it lacks the lived experience of a human student. Educators are using AI to automate the <em>tedious</em> parts of writing (like bibliography formatting) so students can focus on <strong>critical thinking</strong>.</p>

        <p>University of Washington researchers have identified a "Two-Step" method for AI in writing. Students use ChatGPT for <strong>Brainstorming</strong> (Front-end) and Gemini for <strong>Revision</strong> (Back-end), but the "Drafting" (Middle) remains a human-driven process to ensure authentic skill development.</p>
