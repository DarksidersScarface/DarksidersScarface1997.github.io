            <p>
                AI image generators are increasingly being incorporated into GitHub-hosted student newsletters, as more courses emphasize applied use of artificial intelligence in publishing workflows.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent AI image generators available through platforms such as ChatGPT allow users to create images from text prompts and download them for direct use in static websites. These images can be uploaded into GitHub repositories and displayed using standard HTML image tags.
            </p>

            <p>
                Because GitHub Pages supports static image files by default, students can integrate AI-generated visuals without relying on external services or plugins. This makes the process accessible even for users with limited web development experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                The integration of AI-generated media into GitHub-based newsletters reflects a broader trend in applied AI education, where students are expected to deploy AI outputs in real-world publishing environments.

            <h2>Students Begin Using AI Image Generators in GitHub-Based Newsletters</h2>
            <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>

            <p>
                Students working with AI-powered tools are increasingly incorporating AI-generated images into GitHub-hosted newsletters, marking a shift in how visual content is produced for academic publishing.
            </p>

                AI-generated image created using an AI image generator and uploaded directly to a GitHub Pages newsletter.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent AI image tools integrated into platforms such as ChatGPT allow users to generate visuals from text prompts. These images can be downloaded and uploaded directly into GitHub repositories and displayed using standard HTML.

            <p>
                Because GitHub Pages supports static image files by default, students can integrate AI-generated media without using plugins or additional software. This workflow lowers the barrier to publishing visually enhanced content.
            </p>

            <p>
                This trend reflects a broader movement in applied AI education toward deploying AI outputs in real-world contexts. Learning how to integrate AI-generated media responsibly is becoming an essential digital skill.
