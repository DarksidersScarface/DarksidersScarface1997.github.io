            <h2>How AI Writing Tools Are Changing the Revision Process for Students</h2>
            <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>

            <p>
                AI writing tools such as ChatGPT are increasingly being used not just for drafting text, but for revising and improving student writing. Instead of acting as answer generators, these tools are becoming revision assistants that help users refine clarity, structure, and tone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent updates to ChatGPT’s writing-focused features allow users to request feedback on grammar, organization, and argument strength without rewriting the content automatically. Students can ask the AI to explain why a sentence is unclear or suggest alternative phrasing while keeping the original meaning intact.
            </p>

            <p>
                This development is significant because revision is one of the most challenging stages of writing. Many students struggle to identify weaknesses in their own work, especially after reading the same draft repeatedly. AI tools provide immediate, low-pressure feedback that can supplement instructor comments and peer review.
            </p>

            <p>
                The trend reflects a broader shift in education toward responsible AI use. I chose this topic because it demonstrates how AI can support learning while still prioritizing student authorship and critical thinking.
