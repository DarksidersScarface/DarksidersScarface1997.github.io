            <p>At the recent <strong>BETT 2026</strong> conference, Google announced that Gemini is no longer just a separate app. It is now being integrated directly into learning management systems like <strong>Moodle</strong> and <strong>Google Classroom</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>Key Revision Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Rubrics:</strong> Instantly convert any file into a Classroom-ready grading rubric.</li>
                <li><strong>Suggested Feedback:</strong> AI provides writing suggestions to students while they draft, focusing on structural improvements.</li>
                <li><strong>NotebookLM Pilot:</strong> Educators can now see how students interact with AI-led "Gems" for a more transparent learning process.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>The Ethical Shift: Beyond Productivity</h1>
            <p>Hilbert College recently launched its <strong>Ethics in Applied AI</strong> initiative. This program moves away from seeing AI as just a "shortcut" for assignments and refocuses on <em>Analytic Integrity</em>. As Nicholas Best, I find this particularly relevant for our class because it emphasizes that the human must remain "in the loop."</p>
            <p>The curriculum at Hilbert now treats AI as a "contested domain"—a place where students must learn to detect bias and hallucinations while preserving their own unique perspective and voice in their writing.</p>

            <h1>OpenAI: Scaling Literacy Across Borders</h1>
            <p>This week, OpenAI launched the <strong>Education for Countries</strong> initiative. A major focus is their "Learning Accelerator" in India, where they are distributing 500,000 ChatGPT licenses to public school teachers.</p>
            <p>The goal is to provide a "Study Mode" that guides students step-by-step through complex writing and math problems rather than just giving the final answer. This helps prevent "cognitive offloading" and ensures students are actually learning the mechanics of revision.</p>

            <h1>The "PromptLab" Grand Opening</h1>
            <p>UNC-Chapel Hill has unveiled the <strong>Library AI Studio</strong> in Davis Library. At the heart of this studio is <em>PromptLab</em>, a secure platform where students can test top models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude side-by-side.</p>
            <p>One student, an AI Fellow, noted that the custom "revision agents" helped her check her grammar and spelling without rewriting her entire essay. This allows her to keep her original tone and style—a key goal for any student writer in 2026.</p>

            <h1>BETT 2026: The "Productive Struggle"</h1>
            <p>The largest ed-tech conference in the world, <strong>BETT UK 2026</strong>, concluded this week with a clear message: the era of "Junk Food" AI—where students simply ask a bot to write a whole essay—is over.</p>
            <p>Experts emphasized that "the struggle is the bit where you learn." The latest tools showcased at BETT focus on "Vertical AI"—specialized systems that help with high-stakes revision and assessment while keeping the "human in the loop" to ensure that the educator and student are the ones making the final creative decisions.</p>
