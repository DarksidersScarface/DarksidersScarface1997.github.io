    <p>In 2026, ChatGPT is no longer just a chatbot; it's a structural editor. According to <strong>UNESCO's January 2026 update</strong> on the "AI Future of Education," students are moving from basic grammar fixes to "pedagogical co-creation."</p>
    <p>Using specific prompts to identify "wordiness" or "argumentative gaps," students use AI to map out their revision process. This shift ensures that the student remains the author while the AI acts as a sophisticated mirror for their thoughts.</p>

    <p>As of <strong>February 3, 2026</strong>, Google officially rolled out "Gemini in Workspace" for Education Plus users. This brings the "Help Me Write" and a dedicated sidebar directly into Google Docs.</p>
    <p>For students, this means highlighting a complex paragraph and asking Gemini to "simplify for a general audience" without ever leaving the document. This integration reduces distractions and keeps the creative flow intact during the revision phase.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #c0392b;">The Ethics of AI Revision</h1>
    <p>The <strong>Brookings Institution's 2026 Report</strong>, "A New Direction for Students in an AI World," warns that over-reliance on AI can erode "foundational development."</p>
    <p>Our class focus this week is on the "Protect" pillar of this report. We are learning to use Gemini and ChatGPT to suggest changes, but the student must perform the final evaluation. Ethical AI use means the student is the "pilot," and the AI is the "navigator."</p>

    <h1 style="color: #2980b9;">Reverse Outlining: A Tech-First Strategy</h1>
    <p>A "Reverse Outline" is a revision strategy where you ask the AI to summarize your draft. If the AI's summary doesn't match your intended thesis, you know your writing isn't clear yet.</p>
    <p>The <strong>National College Weekly Briefing (Feb 2, 2026)</strong> emphasizes that teacher-designed AI tools are now supporting nearly half a million students in closing the attainment gap through these types of specific, high-level writing strategies.</p>
