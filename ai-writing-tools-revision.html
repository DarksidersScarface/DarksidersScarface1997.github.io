            <h2>Students Begin Using AI Image Generators in GitHub-Based Newsletters</h2>
            <p class="date">January 29, 2026</p>

            <p>
                Students working with AI-powered tools are increasingly incorporating AI-generated images into GitHub-hosted newsletters, marking a shift in how visual content is produced for academic publishing. Instead of sourcing stock images or creating graphics manually, students are now generating custom visuals using AI image generators and embedding them directly into static websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                Recent AI image tools integrated into platforms such as ChatGPT allow users to generate illustrations based on text prompts. These images can then be downloaded and uploaded to GitHub repositories, where they are displayed using standard HTML image tags. This workflow allows students to maintain full control over their site structure while enhancing visual presentation.
            </p>

            <p>
                The process typically involves uploading the generated image directly into the root directory of a GitHub Pages site and referencing the file within an individual post. Because GitHub Pages supports static assets by default, no additional plugins or scripts are required.
            </p>

            <p>
                This development reflects a broader trend in applied AI education, where students are expected to deploy AI-generated content in real-world contexts. As AI-generated media becomes more common, understanding how to integrate it responsibly is becoming an essential digital skill.
